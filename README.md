# books_buy

A small React + Vite application for browsing and managing books. This project uses Vite, React, Tailwind, Supabase for backend/auth, React Query for data fetching, and Zod + React Hook Form for validation.

This README replaces the default Vite template copy with focused project setup and development instructions.

## Tech stack

- 🟦 React 19
- ⚡ Vite
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS
- ☁️ Supabase (JS client)
- 🧭 React Router
- 🧰 React Hook Form
- 🧩 Zod (validation)
- 🔁 TanStack Query (React Query)

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

1. Create a local environment file

Copy the provided example and create a `.env` file in the project root (do NOT commit it):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The `.env.example` contains the expected variables:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

These variable names come from `src/lib/supabaseClient.js` where the Supabase client is created from `import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

1. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser (or the port Vite reports).

## Available scripts

- `npm run dev` — start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` — build for production
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint

The scripts are defined in `package.json`.

## Environment & deployment notes

- Keep Supabase keys secret in production. Use your hosting provider's environment variable settings (for example, Vercel's dashboard) instead of committing secrets.
- This project includes a `vercel.json` file; if you deploy to Vercel, set `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in your Vercel project settings.

## Project structure (high level)

- `src/` — application source
  - `src/lib/supabaseClient.js` — Supabase client initialization
  - `src/pages/` — page components (Home, Books, Admin, Profile, etc.)
  - `src/components/` — shared UI and guards
  - `src/hooks/` — custom hooks (e.g., `useBooks.js`)
  - `src/schemas/` — Zod schemas for forms
